# Ransomware Detection Using Entropy Analysis in Volatility Framework

### **Overview**
This project develops a custom Volatility plugin that uses entropy analysis to detect ransomware patterns and high-entropy memory regions indicative of cryptographic activity. The tool aids in memory forensics and ransomware mitigation by identifying encrypted data and known ransomware signatures in Windows memory dumps.

---

### **Features**
- **Entropy Analysis**: Identifies high-entropy memory regions that may indicate encryption.
- **Ransomware Signature Matching**: Detects known ransomware patterns such as WannaCry.
- **Memory Forensics**: Traverses memory regions to analyze cryptographic activity and potential threats.
- **Detailed Reporting**: Provides a summary of suspicious findings to assist investigators.

---

### **Technologies Used**
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Framework**: Volatility Memory Analysis Framework
- **Techniques**: Shannon Entropy Calculation, Regular Expression Matching
- **Tools**: Volatility Plugin Development, Windows Memory Dump Analysis

---

### **Installation**
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/ransomware-detection-plugin.git
   cd ransomware-detection-plugin
   ```
2. Install the required dependencies (if applicable):
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Add the plugin to your Volatility plugins directory:
   ```bash
   cp myplugin.py /path/to/volatility/plugins/
   ```

---

### **Usage**
1. Run the Volatility framework with the custom plugin:
   ```bash
   python vol.py --plugin=myplugin -f memory_dump.raw
   ```
2. Use additional Volatility commands (e.g., `dlllist`, `handles`) for deeper analysis:
   ```bash
   python vol.py dlllist -f memory_dump.raw
   ```

---

### **Results**
- Scans memory dumps for:
  - High-entropy memory regions with entropy > 7.5.
  - Known ransomware signatures such as file extensions, patterns, and encoded variations.
- Outputs a summary of suspicious processes and memory regions.

---

### **Future Work**
- **Machine Learning Integration**: Incorporate ML algorithms to enhance detection accuracy.
- **Expanded Signature Library**: Include a broader set of ransomware patterns and signatures.
- **Cross-Tool Integration**: Link with other forensic tools for comprehensive analysis.
